# mui-layout
A simple demo app for practice making a responsive dashboard / layout with Material UI and Next JS.

The application layout is based on the free MUI Theme ["Devias Kit - Admin Dashboard"](https://themes.material-ui.com/themes/devias-kit/), by Devias.
  
## Notes
* This project uses `yarn` to manage packages
* The setup for use of material-ui is based on the [material-ui nextjs example](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs)
  * Use `material-ui/core/Link` for external links / urls
  * Use `src/components/Link` for app / page routing
