# mui-layout
A simple demo app for practice making a responsive dashboard / layout with Material UI and Next JS.

## Notes
* This project uses `yarn` to manage packages
* The main UI layout is based on Siriwatknp's [mui-layout](https://github.com/siriwatknp/mui-layout)
* The setup for use of material-ui is based on the [material-ui nextjs example](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs)
  * Use `material-ui/core/Link` for external links / urls
  * Use `src/components/Link` for app / page routing
